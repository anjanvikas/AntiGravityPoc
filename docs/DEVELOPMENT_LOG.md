## 📝 The Story of WeatherScope

### Phase 1: The Pivot
We started with a completely different goal: a **To-Do App**. But mid-way, we realized we wanted something more visual and complex.
- **User**: "Let's switch. I want a weather map."
- **Antigravity**: "Understood. Pivoting to React + Leaflet."
*We didn't just delete files; we scaffolded a new architecture instantly.*

### Phase 2: Building the Core
We needed a map, and we needed it fast.
- **Prompt**: "Create a map component using Leaflet."
- **Action**: Antigravity installed `react-leaflet`, set up the CSS for the map container, and got a basic world map running in minutes.
- **Prompt**: "Add weather data."
- **Action**: We integrated the **Open-Meteo API**. No API keys needed, just pure functional code fetching temperature, wind, and humidity.

### Phase 3: The "Wow" Features
This is where it got interesting. We didn't want a boring map.
- **Dynamic Zoom**: We added logic to zoom in closer for cities (Zoom 10) and stay wide for countries (Zoom 5).
- **Glassmorphism**: We styled the UI with translucent, blurry panels to make it look modern and premium.
- **Precise Boundaries**: Instead of just a pin, we wanted to see the *shape* of the city. We fetched GeoJSON data to draw the actual borders of places like Mumbai and New York.

### Phase 4: Debugging with Agency
It wasn't all smooth sailing. We hit bugs, but Antigravity fixed them.
1.  **The "Invisible Boundary" Bug**: The city shapes weren't showing up.
    -   *Antigravity's Fix*: Realized React wasn't re-rendering the GeoJSON layer when props changed. Added a unique `key` prop to force updates.
2.  **The "Weird Name" Bug**: Clicking the map gave us results like "Road 54, District 9".
    -   *Antigravity's Fix*: Rewrote the logic to ignore road numbers and look for "City", "Town", or "Village" in the address data.

## 🚀 Final Result
A fully functional, interactive weather dashboard built in a fraction of the time it would take a human developer working alone.
